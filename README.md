# NiNJA-Executer



-- This was originally going to be a roblox executer with customizable Ui. --

This is a Ui For an unfinished Roblox executer. 
It doesn't have any exploit. 

I've left it in an unfinished state, I might come back to it some day but probably not. 

Most of the code isn't very good. If you want to improve or release a working or better version, go for it. 


-- About Ryan (The person I was original working with) --

Originally I worked with Ryan on making a stealth service for Xbox 360. However I realized after he couldn't put in "2 Lines" of code
to inject an offhost, that it probably wasn't going to last. So after a while I though he might've changed, so I gave them another chance. 

I tried giving them a chance, but since I was the one who did 99% of the work for this project, I've decided to release it publicly.
